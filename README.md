This assignment consists of two (2) sections:

<ul>

 <li>Java program file(s)</li>

 <li>A screenshot of the execution and source code of your Java program</li>

</ul>

Label each file name according to the section of the assignment for which it is written. Put both sections together in a single zip file, and submit the file.

This assignment is a modification of Assignment 1. The main difference is that instead of using the <strong>System.in.*</strong> and <strong>System.out.*</strong> methods, your will be using the <strong>JOptionPane</strong> class for all the inputs / outputs.

<strong>Section 1: Java Program File(s)</strong>

Modify the Java program that you created from Assignment 1. According to your design, the program must:

<ul>

 <li>Use the JOptionPane class to create a driver program to test your Assignment 1 InsuranceAgentApp Java application.</li>

 <li>Display a new driver test program’s user interface (The interface should look like the image shown below):</li>

</ul>

<strong>Section 1: Java Program File(s)</strong>

Modify the Java program that you created from Assignment 1. According to your design, the program must:

<ul>

 <li>Use the JOptionPane class to create a driver program to test your Assignment 1 InsuranceAgentApp Java application.</li>

 <li>Display a new driver test program’s user interface (The interface should look like the image shown below):</li>

</ul>




The new driver test program’s user interface from Question 1b must:

<ul>

 <li>Include a loop to display the user interface until the user clicks the Quit button.</li>

 <li>Instantiate a PropertyInsurance object and use the JOptionPane.showInputDialog() method to capture the type and riskAmount when the user clicks the Property button.</li>

 <li>Instantiate an AutomobileInsurance object and use the JOptionPane.showInputDialog() method to capture the type and riskAmount when the user clicks the Automobile button.</li>

 <li>Instantiate a TravelInsurance object and use the JOptionPane.showInputDialog() method to capture the type and riskAmount when the user clicks the Travel button.</li>

 <li>Display the quote (totalPremium in the InsuranceAgentApp class) when the user clicks the “Get a Quote” button.</li>

 <li>End when the user clicks the “Quit” button.</li>

</ul>

<strong>Section 2:  Screenshot of the Execution of the Implementation</strong>

<ul>

 <li>Create a screenshot of the execution and include a copy of source code of the implementation.</li>

 <li>Create a screenshot of the execution of the implementation of your Java program. <strong>Note:</strong><a href="http://www.take-a-screenshot.org/">Click here</a> if you need a tutorial on taking a screenshot.</li>

 <li>Submit a copy of source code of the implementation.</li>

</ul>

<strong>Section 1 and Section 2 will be graded based on the following: </strong>

<ol>

 <li>The program must compile, execute, produce correct results, and meet all of the specifications stated in Section 1.  Additionally, you must:</li>

 <li>Organize the code for user readability.</li>

 <li>Organize the code for reusability.</li>

 <li>Organize the code for efficiency.</li>

 <li>Provide documentation with embedded comments for reader understanding.</li>

</ol>

The specific course learning outcomes associated with this assignment are:

<ul>

 <li>Compare and contrast abstract and concrete data types.</li>

 <li>Apply the Java concepts of file input / output.</li>

 <li>Design programs that handle events from user-interface components.</li>

 <li>Use technology and information resources to research issues in Java programing.</li>

</ul>
